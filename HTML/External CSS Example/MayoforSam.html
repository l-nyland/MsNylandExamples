<h1> Mayo for Sam: Mayo GAA</h1>

<img src="mayocrest.jpeg" height="100" width="100">



<p>Mayo is the best football team in the country. Their colours are Red and Green. </p>

<p>Mayo have won the All-Ireland Senior Football competition in 1936, 1950 and 1951. It has been x years since their last All-Ireland win, but they have appeared in 10 finals since 1996. </p>

<h2>The Curse</h2>
<p>Since the 1990s, a sports curse story had circulated that Mayo would not win another All-Ireland until all members of the 1951 team had died. The supposed cause was that the 1951 champions, returning through Foxford in a coach after the win, passed a funeral and did not respectfully stop their celebrations, and were cursed by the priest. The curse claimed that Mayo would not win another All-Ireland title while the members of the winning team were still alive. They have infamously bottled many games since. </p>

<h2>Current Squad</h2>
<p>There are roughly 30 players named each year on the Mayo panel. The three best players are listed below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aiden O'Shea</li>
  <li>Kevin McLoughlin</li>
  <li>Ryan O'Donoghue</li>
</ul>  


<h2>Honours</h2>
